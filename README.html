  <div id="build-config">
    <p class="headline">Build Config</p>
    Boiler Plate Plus+ comes with a configuration file called config.ini which lets important variables be set to a users preference. This is the layout with descriptions of each listed with the defaults:
    <pre>
  [GLOBAL]
  perms = "755"                           ;The permissions given to the build directory
  dev = "dev-server"                      ;Address of the dev server

    Since Boiler Plate Plus+, as many other downloads, require a few files in place, you can run a quick test and make sure you're up to speed and ready to go so you get no surprises later on! Go ahead and run the following command and read the output:

  <h2 class="section">PHP</h2>


  <!--PHP INTRO-->
  <div id="php-intro">
    <p class="headline">PHP Intro</p>
    Boiler Plate Plus+ uses <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> instead of HTML. Don't worry though, they are incredibly similar. In fact, PHP is HTML with the ability to do a few extra things. You can write a full HTML page with a .php extension and the page will still render. What PHP has a benefit over HTML in is the way it can include files and send variables around. That means no code duplication and much less code itself! All you need to know for this introduction is that any php needs to be encapsulated within php tags like this: 
    <pre>
    &lt;?php
  
      //php code goes here
    
    ?>
    </pre>
    <a class="top" href="#">TOP</a>
  </div>


  <!--PHP INCLUDES-->
  <div id="php-includes">
    <p class="headline">PHP Includes</p>
    Lets imagine a horrible scenario. You've made a great website. It has 100 pages exactly because you're precise like that. You wrote the code in HTML because it's familiar. The client signed off on the links at the top of the page. There will be four of them that direct the user to the main parts of the site. Well...that same client just called and now they want a new link! This means you'll have to go back through 100 pages and update the nav. Or...if you used PHP, you just have to do it once and all 100 pages will pick up the changes instantly! How does this work? It's very simple actually, just include the header part in a single file and call that same file into every page!
    <pre>
    &lt;?php
   
     include_once('includes/header.php'); 	
   
     //or
   	
     include('includes/somemodule.html');
   
     ?>    
    </pre>
    There are two examples here. An <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include-once.php">include once</a> and an <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.include.php">include</a>. This should be pretty straight forward. At any point in your html you can create the PHP tags and call in a whole section of HTML. This is commonly done for headers and footers of the page, since those stay the same globally. The main difference between include and include_once is that include will always bring in the file no matter how many times it appears on the page. include_once will only bring in the file once. If there is another call for it, it will be ignored. This helps against human error (like bringing in two headers!)
    <a class="top" href="#">TOP</a>
  </div>


  <!--PHP VARIABLES-->
  <div id="php-variables">
    <p class="headline">PHP Variables</p>
    PHP variables are very simple to understand. Checkout the following demo:
    <pre>
    
      &lt;?php
    
        $variable = "value";
      
        $boolean = true;
    
      ?>
    
    </pre>
    For the most part strings and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type">booleans</a> will be the only things used in this project. 
    <a class="top" href="#">TOP</a>
  </div>


  <!--PHP PARAMETERS IN INCLUDED FILES-->
  <div id="php-variables-includes">
    <p class="headline">PHP Parameters in included files</p>
    Now that you know how to create PHP variables and include files, you're ready to combine them! But why combine? Lets look at a scenario. You have a page that needs to include a div. That div has a background color of green on 5 pages, and red on 3 pages. 99% of the HTML is the same, it's just one class name that needs to be changed (red or green). This is an easy opportunity to be lazy and create two copies of that div with the red and green class. With PHP includes and variables, you don't have to do that. Just set the color you want for the particular page using the example below: (Keep in mind echo is PHP keyword which outputs anything (string, int, boolean, to the screen))
  
    <pre>
    
      &lt;?php
    
        <span class="green">$color = "green";</span>
      
        include('special-div.html');
    
      ?>
    
    </pre>
  
    In the example above, the color variable has been set to green, and then there is a call to include a file called special-div.html. So what needs to happen in the special-div.html? It's very simple:
  
    <pre>
    
      &lt;div id="special" class="<span class="green">&lt;?php echo $color; ?>"</span>>
        &lt;!--Content-->
      &lt;/div>
    
    </pre>
  
    The best thing to take away from this example is that even though these are two separate pages, they are eventually combined and therefore the PHP variables can been seen by both.

  <!--HTML FORMATTING-->
  <div id="html-formatting">
    <p class="headline">HTML Formatting</p>
    This section covers the HTML formatting commonly used front end projects. Although you have the flexibility to alter the pages any which way you'd like, this wouldn't be a true boiler plate if it didn't set you off in the right direction! Here's a rundown of the code with a visual to make some sense of what you're getting.

  <!--HTML BEST PRACTICES-->
  <div id="html-best-practices">
    <p class="headline">HTML Best Practices</p>
    There are a few simple practices you should adopt to make your project easier down the line. These are pretty simple, but can get over looked. I tried my best to force these good practices with my structure of this boiler plate:
    <table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Practice</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Body ID</td>
        <td>Every page should have a body ID unique to the respective page. This helps encapsulate your code from a CSS point of view allowing specific rule targeting for specific pages. This rule also applies to Javascript to help determine if a block of code should be run based on conditionals. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ID/Class Names</td>
        <td>Personally I admit to being incredibly lazy with defining good ID's and classnames. It's very easy to focus on the code you're writing and skip some of the semantics, but I can tell you from experience and general knowledge...take the time to come up with semantically great class names that can give someone completely unfamiliar with your project a clear understanding of what a specific block of code is supposed to do. In fact, a great tip is to layout the page on paper before you start coding and use ID's/classnames to help give you a better idea of what to expect for your page.<br /><br />Never give style-related names to classes or ID. As an example, calling a class <span class="red">'red-error'</span> for a block of text is never a good idea although it may seem like it at the time. What happens if the client comes back and says they want to change the color to black...or pink...or God forbid GREEN. Choose a name more generic like class="error-text"</td>

  <!--JS BEST PRACTICES-->
  <div id="js-best-practices">
    <p class="headline">Javascript Best Practices</p>
    One of the easiest places to be lazy while writing javascript is on the naming convention. Just like naming classes and ID's in HTML, it's easy to skip ahead and go right to the code without giving much thought to semantics. The idea "I'll come back to it later" is very tempting, but the truth of the matter is... "no you won't"...and if you do, you'll probably be rushing through at the end wishing you had taken the time to figure out the semantics earlier because even for you it's starting to become difficult to evaluate what function or variable is used for.

  <!--JS MODULE PATTERN-->
  <div id="js-module-pattern">
    <p class="headline">Javascript Module Pattern</p>
    The Boiler Plate javascript uses what is called the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/247241/Javascript-Module-Pattern">Module Pattern</a>. You don't have to be very familiar with this pattern to use it, especially since there is already a template set up. Just make sure you understand that your code goes inside of 'methods'. The reason this pattern is used is for modularization (as the name suggests). If one module (or page) breaks, you know exactly where it happened and what code is being affected by it. This is compared to writing all the javascript in one file, having to go through a ton of code that all relates to each other, and having to figure out how to change the structure. Sometimes making a fix in one place will break another. That brings up another topic, using the module pattern helps keep a <a href="http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/">closure</a> around variables. This is helpful because global variables are bad in any language.

  <!--JS NATIVE VS JQUERY-->
  <div id="js-vs-jquery">
    <p class="headline">Javascript or jQuery?</p>
    It's very easy to get comfortable with jQuery. Heck it's incredibly quick and convenient. However, that convenience comes at a small price. Speed. Go ahead and google "jquery vs javascript speed" and you'll have a wealth of information. Here are a few links that talk about it:

  <div id="quick-start">
    <h2 class="section">Quick Start</h2>
    Fuck documentation! It's a pain in the ass to write anyway, lets get started:
    
    <div class="terminal">
      <pre>
        $ perl -v
      </pre>
      You should get some response from Perl. If you don't, you need to <a href="http://www.perl.org/get.html">install</a> it! 
      
      <br /><br />
      <strong style="color:red">NOTE!</strong> If you have not run CPAN, you will have to answer "yes" to a few setup questions. For some people sudo needs to be used (depending on where you end up putting these files)
      <pre>
        $ sudo cpan
        
        cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.9456)        
        Enter 'h' for help.

        cpan[1]> <strong>install Config::Simple</strong>
      </pre>
      That's the only Perl add-on needed! Lets go to our project and run a build!
      <pre>
        $ cd /path/to/your/project
        $ make test
      </pre>
      You should see a lot of generated lines. Check in your project directory. You should see a new file called <strong>ITWORKS.zip</strong>. You just zipped your project up! Be sure to make any changes in the config.ini file located in the config directory. Once you have a web server up and running along with a ssh enabled server, you can run a deploy.
